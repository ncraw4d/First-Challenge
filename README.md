# Analysis of Outcomes Based on Fund Raising Launch Dates and Outcomes Based on Goals Chart
The purpose of the analysis is to show Louise what other plays outcomes were based on their launch dates and fundraising goals. 
## Analysis and Challenges
I used the formulas provided by the module challenge and class examples to create the data needed to create two charts. Challenges I encountered were learning that copying and pasting the formula does not automatically provide the correct date. The copied field needs modifications made to it in order to obtain the correct data. I also learned that which graph is chosen determines how the information is shown. I chose the incorrect line graph at first and could not figure out why it did not look correct. Once I chose a different graph it finally looked like the example in the module.

### Conclusions
Two conclusions I can draw from the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date are fundraising campaigns launced in early summer do best and campaigns launched at the end of the year do the worst. I would tell Louise she should time her fundraising launches in late May or early June.

The nexus of a successful campaign is around $15,000. Then there is a window between $35,000 to $45,000 where campaigns are successful again. Louise would benefit from keeping her fundraising goal to under $5,000 where over 50% of campaigns are successful.

#### Limitations of the Dataset
The dataset does not include fundraising campaigns since the Covid pandemic occurred. The pandemic could have considerbly changed the data of how well fundraising campaigns have done. Having the data post 2017 might have given Louise a clearer picture of how well her fundraising will go for future endeavors. The data would have been helped with having a more specific categorization of what type of plays were being funded. If the data showed comedy, drama, political and other categories it would help Louise know if her type of play did better or worse than other types of plays.
##### Other Tables and Graphs
A table showing what the fundraising goal was versus what was pledged would be helpful. Louise could see where plays came in over their fundraising goals and also see how much failed fundraising campaigns failed by. A table that showed how long the fundraising campaigns took could also be useful so she had an idea of the timeframe most plays used between launch date and deadline date.
